12/9/2018 14:28:51	Hello. Our team has been very thoughtful today. I am thinking about the way technology can be used to connect us to what is human and beautiful inside of us or it can be used in a way that alienates us from ourselves and our surroundings. I wish to set an intention that we use it to connect us to ourselves, each other, the land and animals and the wise within us. 	3: Blue Corner	no name	0
